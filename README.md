### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `src/App.js`.  

### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```


### Missing Features

This boilerplate is purposefully simple to show the minimal configuration for React Hot Loader. For a real project, you'll want to add a separate config for production with hot reloading disabled and minification enabled. You'll also want to add a router, styles and maybe combine dev server with an existing server. This is out of scope of this boilerplate, but you may want to look into [other starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#starter-kits).
